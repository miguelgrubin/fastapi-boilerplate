description: Add a new task to the project todo list
---

I need to add a new task to @docs/03-tasks.md.

Please guide me through creating this task interactively:

1. **Task Name**: Ask what the task should be called (format: "Action + description", e.g., "Add user_error_handlers.py", "Implement guards")

2. **Description**: Ask for a brief description of what the task involves

3. **Priority**: Ask which priority section this belongs to:
   - High Priority
   - Medium Priority  
   - Low Priority

After gathering all information, add a new row to the appropriate priority table in the markdown file, maintaining the existing table format:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
